Further steps (4.5.2018)

- Hardware

	/ Get access to a workspace equipped with soldering materials and tools
	/ Build round support, e.g., styrofoam ball or blastic bowl or even a rigid plastic bottle
	/ Redo the buttons such that connections between aluminum and wires are soldered and
	  the wires are soldered onto a male pin.
	/ Find a more durable replacement for the aluminum foil.
	/ Implement acoustic (or any non-visual) feedback once a character has been logged (piezo).

	Eventually: 
	/ Make things wireless. This is nontrivial due to the need for power suppy and short latency 
	  and the question of compatibility with the capacitive sensory.
	/ Build a neat-looking box.

- Software


    / Write an interface to alllow sending messenges (via Facebook) with the device (python selenium)
    / Write a GUI that shows the letters in large format. 
    / Extend this GUI such that it provides a "training mode" where you can re-type random     
      example sentences and obtain information about your speed in chars/min and your progress.
    / Assess the feasibility of a rudimentary auto-complete feature.
